break down multiple filr all seperate componenet
keep in src folder everything

after moving  any componenent from App.js or  from main file to other cmponenet ,make sure export those component on that file , export defalut componenent-name
eg: export default Header;(last line) in Header.js file not in App.js file

and import in Ap.js
below importing react-DOM
eg. import Header from "./componenent/Header"; 
if i have more than two things to export then use direlty export
eg:     export const IMG_URL="https://media-assets.swiggy.com/swiggy/image/upload/fl_lossy,f_auto,    q_auto,w_660/";
        export const LOGO_URL="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTQLe_WuOUKelIF0TI27sP0x_PkdAd6CuXG8Q&s";
        like this 
        for import same things,
        import { IMG_URL } from "./Utils/EssenstialLink"; this is other way

         ->supowerful react variable->you have to import from reacy
         import {useState} from "react"
         2) useEfffect()
         whenever state variable update react re render the component
